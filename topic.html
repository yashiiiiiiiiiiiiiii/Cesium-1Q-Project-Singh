                <p>
                Traffic congestion has been an issue in the Philippines for years. It requires urgent attention because it worsens daily commutersâ€™ mental health. Being stuck in traffic for hours leads to stress and anxiety.    
             </p>
            <p>
                The Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department (2024) mentioned that motorists in Metro Manila lose an average of 117 hours every year due to traffic congestion. For reference, the same report states that drivers spend a total of 240 hours on the road annually, in which they lose around 49% of that time to severe traffic congestion. the cities of Davao, Manila, and Caloocan were included in the top 20 of the worst cities globally in terms of hours lost in traffic. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Traffic congestion is a major blockade that restricts the Philippine's potential, but overcoming this will lead to a clearer path to success.
